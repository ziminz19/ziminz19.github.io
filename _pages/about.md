I'm Zimin Zhang, a CS Master student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) starting from 2024 Fall, working with Prof. Hao Peng. Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in Math of Computation and Statistics from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Yizhou Sun.

My research focues on **LLM post-training** and **mechanistic interpretability**, especially on understanding the internal mechanisms of LLM reasoning and improving LLM reasoning with latent space reasoning using RL.
